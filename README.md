# Coding Diary
Since I have tons of day not touching coding, especially scraping. It is a difficult time to learn a new method. Why I would say that, because the web page is hard to collect the data. The web page is written in dynamic JavaScript, not like the simple web page (wiki) that I can only use get post such request model to get the data. It is my first time use Selenium, so I spent few days to learn and familiar it. After knowing Selenium, the TDCC web page is such a difficult page to use. It cannot type in the blank, only way is to click every button. Therefore, I need to imitate how human use the web page. Every movement has to be precisely and waiting the web page loading. Finally, I finish the work.
It is a special experience to use the new tool. It can be used in so many place like RPA robot or some routine and simple work.
